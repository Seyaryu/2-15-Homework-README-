# README Generator

This program uses the inquirer package of npm (https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) to ask you questions to help make a simple README file.

There is no HTML or CSS to this project; everything is done within your terminal/gitBash/command window.

Here is a link to a video of the generator in action:
